foobar_sync workflow:
	Syncer:
		1. exports playlist via contextmenu
		2. that creates a torrent file with the playlist files
		3. torrent file gets uploaded to our server
		4. user is presented with a link to the torrent

	Syncee:
		1. imports the torrent link via file menu
		2. the torrent is downloaded
		3. a playlist is generated from the torrent (using sync://infohash/filename paths)
		4. sync_playlist object is created which can be looked up by the corresponding infohash
		5. sync_playlist is used for tracking download progress and io synchronization (map of piece indices and promises)
